## Frontend State Management
- Local state with useState for UI components

- Props drilling for data flow
- Mock data for development

## UI/UX Patterns

- Slide-out panels (cart, filters)
- Multi-step flows (checkout, onboarding)
- Real-time validation
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Toast notifications
- Responsive design

## Security Considerations
- JWT token storage (localStorage/cookies)
- HTTPS enforcement
- Input validation
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection needed
- Rate limiting required

## Performance Considerations
- Image optimization needed
- Lazy loading for products
- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching strategy required
- Bundle size optimization

## Integration Points
- Stripe for payments
- OpenAI/Claude for AI chat
- Email service for notifications
- File storage (S3/Cloudinary) for uploads
- Analytics service (optional)

## Next Steps for Backend
1. Implement all identified API endpoints
2. Set up real-time WebSocket for chat
3. Configure payment gateway
4. Integrate AI service
5. Set up email notifications
6. Implement file upload system
7. Add caching layer
8. Set up monitoring and logging
