## Technical Debt & Considerations

1. **Security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Security headers configuration
   - Input sanitization

2. **Performance**
   - Database query optimization
   - Implement pagination cursors
   - Add response compression
   - CDN for static assets

3. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling preparation
   - Microservices consideration
   - Queue system for heavy tasks
   - Database sharding strategy

## Development Environment

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Configure database and other settings
npm run dev
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Database Setup
```bash
# Ensure PostgreSQL is running
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate
```

## Key Decisions Made

1. **TypeScript Throughout**: Ensures type safety across the entire stack
2. **Prisma ORM**: Provides type-safe database access with excellent DX
3. **JWT with Refresh Tokens**: Secure authentication with token rotation
4. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability
5. **Mock AI Initially**: Allows frontend development while AI integration pending

## Risks & Mitigation

1. **AI Service Costs**: Implement caching and rate limiting
2. **Database Performance**: Add indexes and optimize queries
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and updates
4. **Scalability Issues**: Design for horizontal scaling from the start
